Boids

Here it is, my second chance at Boids. Now using physics which took me a while to understand. You know bad at math and all.
But successs!!! Sort of. The whole boids thing works, only main issue with this assignemnt is the performance.
The simulation is sloooow. It shouldn't be the case cause I did it in C++ and OpenGL. I'm doing something wrong.
